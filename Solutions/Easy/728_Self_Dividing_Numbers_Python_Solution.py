#Python Solution
#Have to use for loops and iterations to check the condition
#Create an empty list first
#Then iterate a for loop in the range specified
#Then for each iteration, convert it to a string, and run a for loop for each value in the string.
#If the value is 0 or the modulus isn't 0, then break the loop.
#else, append the value into the list
