#Pandas Solution
#First merge the two dataframes
#Then get the total no. of participants independently in a different variable
#Group the merged DF by contest id and count the total users for each contest
#Create a new column called 'percentage' to get the percentage. The values will be 100* total_registered participants divided by the total participants
#Lastly, use the .round method
