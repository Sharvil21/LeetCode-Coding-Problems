#Pandas Solution
#First combine the lat lon columns so its easier to group by.
#Then create another Dataframe where we get only the Unique lat and lon
#Create another dataframe where we get only those tiv_2015 which are duplicates
#Get the corresponding lat_lon values from the 1st df. Then get the corresponding tiv_2015 values from the other df
